This is a collection of macros to assist the user by suggesting a configure step or make step
for a number of pieces of the web stack which when installed will be capable of supporting one
or more openacs instances.

The Makefile has a list of the files which the builder will look at. It's been arranged so that
when you change any of the macro files, running make will rewrite any hint files which depend
on the changed files.

You can begin by editing openacs-tools.m4 and specifying the path to the prefix where all the 
software will be installed, and the path to the postgres database configuration executable; using
this, the build processes will use these paths to find what the build needs to complete. Then,
run make in that source dir to produce the actual hint files. Then just read those and run 
the commands you find.

The normal thing to do for the configure steps, is run configure as stated in the hint file, then
run make and make install. In a coupla cases, there is not a configure script, so in that case
you'd run the make command in the hint file, and run it again with the word "install" at the end.
